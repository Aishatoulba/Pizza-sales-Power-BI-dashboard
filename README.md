# Pizza sales Power BI dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that visualizes data on pizza sales. The dashboard provides an interactive view of the data, allowing users to explore the data and gain insights about the total sales and take decisions based on these insights.

The dashboard includes several visualizations, including:

- Total pizza sales Amount by State
- Total sales by store Manager
- Sales Amount and Sales target by day , to see on which days we have been able to meet our sales target , and on which we haven't.
- Sales Amount by pizza type : which pizza type has most sales?

The dashboard is built using Microsoft Power BI,  a platform for creating and sharing data visualizations. The dataset is included in the repository.
